## Core Philosophy

This platform is built on **dual-persona** design principles that serve both students and working professionals:

### 1. **Professional-First Design**
**Time-Scarcity Optimization**: Micro-learning sessions (15-30 min), weekend intensives, and work-aware scheduling for busy professionals balancing career and learning.

### 2. **Career Integration Intelligence**  
**Real-World Application**: Every concept connects to professional advancement - workplace applications, skill market value, and career impact measurement.

### 3. **Adaptive Dual-Persona System**
**Smart Persona Detection**: Automatically adapts interface, scheduling, and features based on whether you're a student (flexible schedule) or working professional (time-constrained).

### 4. **Strategic Precision** (Universal)
Forces focus on high-yield areas through a user-defined tier system, preventing wasted effort on low-value topics.

### 5. **Adaptive Resilience** (Universal)
Uses a feedback loop of mock test analysis and health tracking to constantly refine the study plan and prevent burnout.

### 6. **Contextual Mastery** (Universal)  
Moves beyond rote memorization by requiring users to create personal connections for each topic, mirroring contextual learning principles.
