whatever we've implemented so far, verify every single page, every single component, every single file, every single line. check is this as per our expectation? are we updating everything in database using firebase with best practices? when we connect the dots, is everything logically make sense? is this as per best practices? Is every component perfectly polished? is this best UI/UX?  if not then please fix it. let's have perfect version. not just for this but for every feature in entire project.
