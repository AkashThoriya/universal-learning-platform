# 📋 Exam Strategy Engine — Documentation Hub

This `docs/` folder contains the project's documentation. I've reorganized the hub to accurately list and categorize every markdown file currently present in the folder and added a lightweight, navigable index at `docs/INDEX.md`.

## How this is organized

- Core docs: strategic and implementation guides
- System & architecture: database and integration patterns
- Implementation & setup: how-tos and troubleshooting
- Reference & status: project status, issues, and notes

Please open `docs/INDEX.md` for a categorized list of files and short descriptions.

## Quick actions
