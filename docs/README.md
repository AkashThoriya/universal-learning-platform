## 🎯 **Core Learning Concept**

Our platform supports **two unified learning tracks**:

### **📚 Exam Track** (Competitive Exams)
**Validation Pipeline**: Mock Tests → Revision Cycles → Main Exam
- Students preparing for competitive exams
- Working professionals seeking certifications  
- Freelancers expanding their qualifications

### **💻 Course/Tech Track** (New Skills & Technologies)  
**Validation Pipeline**: Assignments → Projects → Skill Certification
- Students learning new technologies
- Working professionals upskilling for career growth
- Freelancers adding technical capabilities

Both tracks use the same **unified persona-aware system** that intelligently adapts content, pacing, and validation methods based on user context and goals.
